This project is a Command Line Interface version of the popular game Wordle. I used Python to code the logic of the game and SQL Alchemy to create user login information and to populate a database of words to draw from. 
I also incorporated some fun ASCII art into the game. 
It was a great learning experience to expand my Python skills and hard-code the logic of a seemingly simple game into a usable and enjoyable user experience.
